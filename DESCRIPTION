        Frames with Factors

Description: It provides a function that calculates the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of species in a list of data frames. Each data frame contains the observations of a species with some factors. Mahalanobis distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two vectors of multivariate random variables, based on the covariance matrix. This distance is useful for statistical matching or fusion of data, that is the integration of two data sources that refer to the same target population and that share some variables.
