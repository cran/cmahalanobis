\title{Calculate the Euclidean distances for each pair of factors or for the index.}
\usage{
ceuclide(
  dataset,
  formula,
  plot = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Euclidean Distance Between Groups",
  min_group_size = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataframe.}

\item{formula}{The index of the dataframe, otherwise a variable or variables (two or more) with factors which you want to calculate the Euclidean distances matrix or matrices (two or more).}

\item{plot}{Logical, if TRUE, a plot or plots (two or more) of the Euclidean distances matrix or matrices about factors (two or more) are displayed.}

\item{plot_title}{If plot is TRUE, the title to be used for plot or plots about factors. The default value is TRUE.}

\item{min_group_size}{Minimum group size to maintain. The default value is 3, therefore factors, inside variables, with less than 3 observations will be discarded. For "index", this value is always 1.}
}
\value{
According to the option chosen in formula, with "index" the Euclidean distance matrix will be printed; instead, by specifying variables, the Euclidean distances matrix or matrices (two or more) between each pair of groups and, optionally, the plot or plots (two or more) will be printed.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe and a variable or variables (two or more) in input, and returns a matrix or matrices (two or more) with the Euclidean distances about each pair of factors inside them. You can also select "index" to calculate the Euclidean distances between each row.
}
\note{
If "index" is selected with variables, only distances between rows are calculated. Therefore, this snippet: "ceuclide(mtcars, ~am + carb + index)" will print distances only considering "index". Rows with NA values are omitted.

\examples{

# Example with iris dataset

data(iris)

ceuclide(iris, ~Species, plot = TRUE, 
plot_title = "Euclidean Distance Between Groups", min_group_size = 2)

# Example with mtcars dataset

data(mtcars)

ceuclide(mtcars, ~am + carb, plot = TRUE, 
plot_title = "Euclidean Distance Between Groups", min_group_size = 3)

# Calculate ceuclide for index
res <- ceuclide(mtcars, ~index, 
min_group_size = 3)
