\title{Calculate the Minkowski distances for each pair of factors or for the index.}
\usage{
cminkowski(
  dataset,
  formula,
  p = 3,
  plot = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Minkowski Distance Between Groups",
  min_group_size = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataframe.}

\item{formula}{The index of the dataframe, otherwise a variable or variables (two or more) with factors which you want to calculate the Minkowski distances matrix or matrices (two or more).}

\item{p}{Order of the Minkowski distance.}

\item{plot}{Logical, if TRUE, a plot or plots (two or more) of the Minkowski distances matrix or matrices about factors (two or more) are displayed.}

\item{plot_title}{If plot is TRUE, the title to be used for plot or plots about factors. The default value is TRUE.}

\item{min_group_size}{Minimum group size to maintain. The default value is 3, therefore groups, inside variables, with less than 3 observations will be discarded. For "index", this value is always 1.}
}
\value{
According to the option chosen in formula, with "index" the Minkowski distances matrix will be printed; instead, by specifying variables, the Minkowski distances matrix or matrices (two or more) between each pair of groups and, optionally, the plot or plots (two or more) will be printed.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe and a variable or variables (two or more) in input, and returns a matrix or matrices (two or more) with the Minkowski distances about the factors inside them. You can also select "index" to calculate the Minkowski distances between each row.
}
\note{
When p < 1, the Minkowski distance is a "dissimilarity" measure. When p >= 1, 
the triangle inequality property is satisfied and we say "Minkowski distance". If "index" is selected with variables, only distances between rows are calculated. Therefore, this snippet: "cminkowski(mtcars, ~am + carb + index)" will print distances only considering "index". Rows with NA values are omitted.

\examples{
# Example with iris dataset

data(iris)

cminkowski(iris, ~Species, p = 3, plot = TRUE, 
plot_title = "Minkowski Distance Between Groups")

# Example with mtcars dataset

data(mtcars)

cminkowski(mtcars, ~am, p = 3, plot = TRUE, 
plot_title = "Minkowski Distance Between Groups")

# Calculate the Minkowski distance for 32 car models in "mtcars" dataset
res <- cminkowski(mtcars, ~index, p = 2, plot = TRUE)
