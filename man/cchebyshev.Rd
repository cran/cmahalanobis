\title{Calculate the p_values matrix for each species, using Chebyshev distance as a base.}
\usage{
cchebyshev(
  dataset,
  formula,
  plot = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Chebyshev Distance Between Groups"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataframe.}

\item{formula}{A factor which you want to calculate Chebyshev distance.}

\item{plot}{If TRUE, displays a plot of distances.}

\item{plot_title}{The title of plot.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing distances and, optionally, the plot.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataset, a factor, a p_value method, number of bootstraps and permutation when necessary, and returns a p_values matrix between each pair of species and a plot if the user select TRUE using the Chebyshev distance for the distances calculation.

\examples{
# Example with iris dataset

cchebyshev(iris, ~Species, plot = TRUE, plot_title = "Chebyshev Distance Between Groups")

# Example with mtcars dataset

cchebyshev(mtcars, ~am, plot = TRUE, plot_title = "Chebyshev Distance Between Groups")
